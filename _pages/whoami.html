<h1>hello, I'm <span class=font-mono>w<span class=text-purple-600>0</span>lfram<span class=text-purple-600>1</span>te</span>.</h1>

<p>As of writing, I have the following certifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH)</li>
  <li>Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)</li>
</ul>

<p>My interests vary but mostly revolve around tech and <b>information security</b> related stuff. I love dabbling in different fields - so expect a mish-mash of content for this website. Here are some of the infosec ones I've tried off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
  <li>penetration testing</li>
  <li>red teaming</li>
  <li>reverse engineering</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, in the future, I'd like to get into or get more exposure in the following fields (though this is subject to change at a moment's notice):</p>

<ul>
  <li>incident handling</li>
  <li>exploit development</li>
  <li>tooling/scripting research and development</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is this site for?</h3>

<p>This website was created to serve as an online log of information security and information security-adjacent things that I get around to doing (and documenting). Ideally it also helps other people in their endeavors.</p>

<p>It also serves as some form of accountability to improve on my documentation and technical writing skills.</p>
