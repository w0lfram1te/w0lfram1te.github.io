<h1>hello, I'm <span class=font-mono>w<span class=text-purple-600>0</span>lfram<span class=text-purple-600>1</span>te</span>.</h1>

<p>
  I tend to write about whatever I find interesting or worth writing about at the moment. Expect to see varying topics but most things should be at least tangentially related to cybersecurity such as penetration testing, red teaming, and reverse engineering.

<p>
  Though recently I have been dabbling in cloud-based devops, possibly things related to data science/engineering, among others so anything can happen topic-wise.
