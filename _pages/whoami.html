<h1>hello, I'm <span class=font-mono>w<span class=text-purple-600>0</span>lfram<span class=text-purple-600>1</span>te</span>.</h1>

<p>I'm currently working as an <b>information security analyst</b>  in a small but quickly growing company working mainly on penetration testing and vulnerability assessment engagements, among other things.</p>

<p>My interests vary but mostly revolve around tech and <b>information security</b> related stuff. I'd love to try dabble in different fields. Here are some of the ones I've tried off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
  <li>penetration testing</li>
  <li>social engineering</li>
  <li>reverse engineering</li>
  <li>malware analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, in the future, I'd like to get into or get more exposure in the following fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>incident handling</li>
  <li>red teaming</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is this site for?</h3>

<p>This website was created to serve as an online log of information security and information security-adjacent things that I get around to doing (and documenting). Ideally it also helps other people in their endeavors.</p>

<p>It also serves as some form of accountability to improve on my documentation and technical writing skills.</p>
